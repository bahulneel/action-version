# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the action-version GitHub Action.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide context for why decisions were made and help future contributors understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows the format defined by [Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):

1. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
2. **Date** - When the decision was made
3. **Context** - The forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local
4. **Decision Drivers** - Requirements, constraints, and goals that influenced the decision
5. **Considered Options** - Alternative approaches that were evaluated
6. **Decision Outcome** - The change that we're proposing or have made
7. **Consequences** - What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced
8. **Implementation Details** - Technical details about how the decision is implemented
9. **Links** - References to related documentation, patterns, or resources
